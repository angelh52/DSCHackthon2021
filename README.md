// dormitory

During this pandemic, we should do our best to avoid contacting with others.

Living in the dormitory makes us think of a question: How to get our meal without walking out?
The answer to the question may be quite simple: food delivery system, but what if a dormitory with hundreds of people order the meal at the same time? This may result in lots of people swarming the entrance for the delivery.

And this is what we want to improve, we hope to develop a website that will arrange the time for the students to get their meal one by one to keep decent social distance
